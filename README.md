# Land-Mongul

* Land Mogul is an auction game played by two to 4 players. In the game, players will try to rival each other by bidding the most profitable land parcel, and try to become the richest 
player by end of 10 rounds of bidding exercises.

# GAME PLAY

* At the start of a new game, each player will be given a $100 million dollars in the bank. Before the start of each biding exercise, each player will be given a brief introduction 
of the land that they will be bidding and following up a news flash. Each player supposes to make a quick judgement if the land parcel is worth bidding for. 

* After the start of the bidding exercise, a timer will start to countdown from 90 seconds. Within the 90 seconds, there may be up to 3 news flash that may influence the price of the 
land parcel in the future. Therefore, each player will have to make their best judgement with the available information.

* After the bidding has ended, a final news flash will be released to inform all the players on the actual market price of the land parcel. The land parcel will then be sold back to 
the bank. If a player has won the bid, the bank will credit the profit or deduct the losses from the player account.

# AUCTION PLAY

* There will be a minimum bidding price set by the game at the start of the auction. All players are eligible to bid for the land parcel as long as their bank account needs the 
minimum bid requirement. Players can also choose not to bid in the auction.

* All players will begin their bid by bidding the minimum bidding price set by the game. Subsequently, all bidding will be incremental by $100k. If a player can choose to bid more 
than the incremental value of $100k, however, the auction board will only show the last bidding price plus $100k. The system will then keep the player’s highest bidding value as a 
reserved price. The reserved price will only made know to the player that place the bid. For example, if the player A decides to bid $1.5million dollars on a minimum bid value of 
$1mil of a land parcel, the auction board will only show player A bidding price is $1.1mil. If player B decided to bid $1.2mil, the system will automatic show the highest bidder is 
still Player A at $1.3mil; bidding is incremental by $100k. The process will go on until other player bid above $1.5mil.
